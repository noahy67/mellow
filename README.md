### CalHacks Submission
Mellow is a mental health assistance website focused on getting the less fortunate quick and reliable answers about their mental health questions. Our app utilizes Co:here's NLP technology to accept input in the form of questions or concerns from patients and maps the input to a specific area of mental health disorders classified by the WHO. Then, we forward these questions anonymously to the most available professional in that field whose answer is shot back to the user to provide them with direction and clarity. All patient, professional, and disorder information is stored using Cockroach DB Serverless.
